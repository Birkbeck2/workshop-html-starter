        <p>Over 340 university and public libraries worldwide already support
          us, which makes our platform safe and sustainable. As this support
          grows, we expand our portfolio of humanities journals by “flipping”
          subscription titles. This provides a route to diamond open access
          that is affordable and sustainable.</p>
        <p>We also invest in building open-source publishing technologies
          that benefit the entire academic community. Investing in our own
          publishing platform means we can offer cutting-edge technology to our
          journals at a sustainable cost for our international library
          partners. It also safeguards the OLH against acquisition, ensuring
          our ongoing independence from commercial publishers.</p>

        <p>The OLH model has been built around the specific needs of
          humanities scholars. It works because we are embedded in the academic
          communities that we serve. Our model harnesses support from libraries
          and funders to protect niche fields and preserve research cultures
          that are at risk from austerity cuts to humanities research
          funding.</p>
        <p>It is also grounded in an understanding that humanities
          disciplines face specific challenges. They are often poorly funded
          and less likely to benefit from research investment than the
          sciences. Postgraduates, independent scholars, less
          “research-intensive” institutions, and academics in the Global South
          are also disproportionately disadvantaged by an “author pays” system
          of open-access publishing.</p>
        <p>Our model has been influential in the shift towards
          community-governed, not-for-profit open-access publishing because it
          addressed these issues. And it continues to work because we are
          aligned with the mission of libraries. Despite competitive market
          forces, we work in partnership with our library network to maximise
          societal access to research in the broadest sense.</p>
