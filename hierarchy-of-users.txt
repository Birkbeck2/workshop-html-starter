Hierarchy of road users The ‘hierarchy of road users’ is a concept that places
those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the
hierarchy. The hierarchy does not remove the need for everyone to behave
responsibly. The road users most likely to be injured in the event of a
collision are pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists, with
children, older adults and disabled people being more at risk. The following H
rules clarify this concept. Rule H1 It is important that ALL road users are
aware of The Highway Code, are considerate to other road users and understand
their responsibility for the safety of others. Everyone suffers when road
collisions occur, whether they are physically injured or not. But those in
charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision
bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to
others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and
passenger vehicles, vans/minibuses, cars/taxis and motorcycles. Cyclists, horse
riders and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles likewise have a responsibility to
reduce danger to pedestrians. None of this detracts from the responsibility of
ALL road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders, to have regard
for their own and other road users’ safety. Always remember that the people you
encounter may have impaired sight, hearing or mobility and that this may not be
obvious.
